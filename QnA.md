> What do you think are the greatest risk areas in completing the project?

- Now that I've completed the first prototype of the project, I found some of the biggest risk areas to be in routing, handling state amongst the different parts of the app and asynchronous calls with the backend.  It's also challenging to manage the views appropriately.

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- There are only upvotes - downvotes should definitely be a consideration
- Ability to select categories or have tags associated with the post
- Brighter colours

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.
-  Add and post images
-  Private messaging to other users
-  Provide areas where discussion for other topics can be made (i.e. subreddits)

> Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

- I currently used redux-only for this project.  The reason was to gain a more familiar grounding with how redux works with react, which means I did not call setState at all in this application.
- Use of bootstrap for CSS to develop the project quicker

> How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

- Learning Framework: 15 hours
- Coding: 8 hours
- Debugging: 15 hours

> If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

- Review the fundamentals of web development beforehand (i.e. CSS, JavaScript)
- Not be so adamant about staying with Redux (some aspects of the project are much suited towards conventional React principles)

> Did you learn anything new?

- I gained some exposure to asynchronous JS, Redux, React, Redux-Form and React-Router and middleware packages like axios and redux-thunk
- Learned about the many kinds of  material libraries that can be used to make the UI / UX more appealing

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

- This might be a better question for a new graduate, but I do believe this assignment actually helped give me a basic understanding of how applications are put together on the web.  It was very challenging considering my current skill level in web development, having mostly done university courses up to this point.

> Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this excercise? If so, what are they?

- N/A
